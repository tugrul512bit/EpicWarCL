# EpicWarCL
C# fully OpenCL(C99)-accelerated game demo and benchmark, prealpha- stage abondonware.

Files with cl extension were only for curious people to let them know what kind of 
kernel functions are running. Real codes are inside cs file on  a string variable. 
This way at least cheaters can't simply get higher points by altering cl files.
But now its open source, so anyone can cheat.
